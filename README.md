# Heart-Disease-Prediction-

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes.
This project uses Machine Learning algorithms to predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on various health parameters.

The goal of this project is to build an accurate predictive model using the Kaggle Heart Disease Dataset (or any similar dataset) and evaluate different ML algorithms.


## What This Project Does

Takes patient details like age, blood pressure, cholesterol, chest pain type, etc.
Uses a trained machine learning model to predict:
0 → No Heart Disease
1 → Heart Disease Present
Shows accuracy of the model to understand how well it performs.

## Technologies Used

Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for graphs)
Jupyter Notebook
